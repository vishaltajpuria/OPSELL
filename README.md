# OPSELL

A mobile web app for browsing NSE F&O (futures & options) stocks and their live option chains, using your Zerodha account as the data source. It's built to be added to your iPhone home screen so it behaves like a regular app, no App Store needed.

**Where things stand right now:** you can log in with Zerodha and see the F&O scanner — every NSE stock with listed futures & options, split into **Liquid** and **Illiquid** tabs, plus an **Indices** tab for Nifty, Bank Nifty, Fin Nifty, Midcap Nifty, and Sensex. Tapping a stock opens its live option chain (strikes, LTP, open interest) for any expiry. The **Strategy** tab is a placeholder — that's where your Supertrend/SMA-based buy/sell signals will plug in once you share the rules.

**How Liquid vs. Illiquid is decided:** each stock's near-month futures contract has an open interest and a today's-volume number from Zerodha. Both are ranked against every other F&O stock (as a percentile, 0–100), the two ranks are averaged into one score, and stocks scoring above the market's median go in Liquid, the rest in Illiquid. It's computed fresh from live quotes on every page load — no separate database or background job.

## 1. Get a Zerodha Kite Connect API key

This app needs its own API key to talk to your Zerodha account (this is separate from your regular login).

1. Go to <https://developers.kite.trade/apps> and log in with your Zerodha credentials.
2. Click **Create new app**, choose **Connect** as the type, and give it any name (e.g. "OPSELL").
3. For **Redirect URL**, enter: `https://YOUR-DEPLOYED-URL/api/kite/callback` (you'll get the real URL in step 2 below — you can come back and fill this in afterwards).
4. Kite Connect is a paid API (Zerodha charges a small monthly fee for it, shown on that page) — you'll need to subscribe to use it.
5. Once created, you'll see an **API key** and **API secret**. You'll need both in the next step.

## 2. Deploy the app (no coding required)

The easiest way is [Vercel](https://vercel.com), which is free for personal projects:

1. Sign up at vercel.com (you can sign in with your GitHub account).
2. Click **Add New → Project**, and import this repository.
3. Before deploying, open **Environment Variables** and add:
   - `KITE_API_KEY` — from step 1
   - `KITE_API_SECRET` — from step 1
4. Click **Deploy**. Vercel will give you a URL like `https://opsell-yourname.vercel.app`.
5. Go back to your Kite Connect app settings (step 1) and set the **Redirect URL** to `https://opsell-yourname.vercel.app/api/kite/callback`.

## 3. Add it to your iPhone home screen

1. Open your deployed URL in **Safari** on your iPhone (must be Safari, not Chrome).
2. Tap the **Share** icon (square with an arrow) in the toolbar.
3. Tap **Add to Home Screen**.

It'll now open full-screen from your home screen like a normal app.

## 4. Using it day to day

- Open the app and tap **Connect to Zerodha** on the Settings tab, then log in with your Zerodha credentials.
- Zerodha access tokens expire every day (usually overnight), so you'll need to tap **Connect to Zerodha** again each trading day.
- Browse F&O stocks and tap one to see its option chain for the nearest expiry (you can switch expiries from the dropdown).

## Notes for whoever maintains this later

- Built with Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
- Talks to Kite Connect directly over `fetch` (no third-party Kite SDK), to avoid pulling in that SDK's outdated, vulnerable transitive dependencies.
- The instrument dump is cached in memory per server process for 6 hours; on serverless hosts each cold start refetches it once.
- `app/strategy/page.tsx` is where the LLM-driven strategy routine will plug in once the desired option-selling rules are defined.
